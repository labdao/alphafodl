## **Mission**

Our mission is to accelerate life science innovation and collaboration by creating new mechanisms and markets for the exchange of R&D services and scientific data.

## **Guiding Beliefs**

1. Harnessing the power of biology will give humanity the ability to solve the greatest problems facing our species and our planet. To accelerate innovation in the life sciences **(1)** capital must become more easily accessible, and **(2)** resources must be used more efficiently.‍
2. Web3 technology enables better coordination of social behavior, labor, and capital through the design of new incentive mechanisms. Novel tools and systems are emerging to [fund science](https://www.vitadao.com/), trade [intellectual property](https://www.molecule.to/) (IP), and [incentivize collaboration and cooperation](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ethereum-slayer-of-moloch-) between diverse groups.
3. Standardizing life science R&D protocols will enable greater collaboration and the creation of a better market for R&D services and data. Transforming protocols and IP into composable technological primitives unlocks new methods of using, sharing, and trading valuable scientific data which might otherwise be locked away in private companies or in the academic world. This could ultimately offer new ways to diversify assets and reduce risk in drug development.

## **Smart Protocols and the LabDAO Marketplace**

LabDAO is a community that is developing an open-source platform to buy and sell scientific services. A transparent marketplace for laboratory services that connects academic labs, biotechnology companies, and contract research organizations (CROs) can enable **(1)** a more efficient procurement process, **(2)** opportunities to collaborate on pre-competitive research, and **(3)** the ability to pool orders among small market participants to improve purchasing power. We believe that creating a market will allow useful standards to emerge.

LabDAO is expanding on the [Molecule Protocol](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol-a47978dd914) [IP-NFT standard](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/molecules-biopharma-ipnfts-a-technical-description-4dcfc6bf77f8) to introduce **smart protocols**. Smart protocols provide a standardized format for the specifications of R&D services and the data it produces, and allow this information to be securely stored and encrypted [on-chain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/storage/) together with associated experimental results. This allows ownership of data to be unambiguously assigned and creates new possibilities for co-ownership of IP **through the **fractionalization of IP-NFTs**. A reliable and composable framework for generating, validating, tracing, and owning experimental data gives us the opportunity to build a new economy around the trade of valuable scientific data and the experimental work that produces it.

Implementation of smart protocols will allow labDAO to build **an open-access marketplace for R&D services** where users can easily buy and sell scientific services. Unlike existing examples of R&D service  marketplaces, labDAO will leverage web3 technology to incentivize collaboration, transparency, reproducibility, and participation on both sides of the marketplace. 

Biotech companies, CROs, and academic institutions can all benefit from participating in an open marketplace that is built around a **standardized language** for experiments and IP ownership. As scientists and entrepreneurs we understand the value of IP, but also recognize that discovery is not always a zero-sum game. Smart protocols and a decentralized marketplace (collectively, our **platform**) will make sure that it’s easy to collaborate when it **makes more sense to work together**. 

## **Building as a Community**

As a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) (DAO), labDAO will give contributors *and* users of the platform ownership and governance rights through **$LAB governance tokens** (*launch date TBA*). This token-based governance system allows incentives to be aligned between *all* stakeholders – and gives us mechanisms to reward diverse sets of contributors for their help in building, growing, operating, and maintaining the platform.

By ensuring that users, contributors, and investors all share in the potential upside of the platform, we create a powerful flywheel for the network effects needed to make a marketplace succeed. With this organization model, labDAO can bring together the unique talent pool and capital needed to execute this plan.

## **How to Help**

Whether you’re a scientist, a biotech expert, a web3 builder, a tokenomics guru, or just believe in the power of biotechnology to change our world: **we invite you to join our [community](https://discord.gg/labdao) and help use new mechanisms to build the decentralized R&D network of the future.**‍
